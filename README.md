# pluma

_a work-in-progress..._

A small, dynamic functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.

## goals

By targeting the same AST format that [Babel](Babel) uses, Pluma aims to enable you to transpile however you want, using whatever Babel plugins/transformers/minifiers you normally would.
